Port 21 — FTP (vsftpd, etc.)
--------------------------------
Description:
- FTP (File Transfer Protocol) commonly runs on TCP port 21. Services like vsftpd may expose banners revealing versions.
- Some obsolete FTP servers (or misconfigured/old versions) include known backdoors or RCE PoCs.

Risk Assessment (example scale: Likelihood 1-3, Impact 1-3)
- Likelihood: 3 (public PoC / Metasploit modules exist for some versions)
- Impact: 3 (possible remote shell / root on vulnerable systems)
- Risk Score: 9 — Severity: High

Recommendation:
- Disable FTP if not needed; use SFTP/FTPS.
- Patch/update vsftpd or other FTP services.
- Restrict access with firewall rules and monitor logs.
