Port 139 — NetBIOS/SMB over NetBIOS
------------------------------------
Description:
- Port 139 is used for NetBIOS Session Service (legacy SMB over NetBIOS). Often present alongside port 445.
- Exposes NetBIOS names, shares and can reveal user/share information if not protected.

Risk Assessment
- Likelihood: 2 (depends on share configuration and credentials)
- Impact: 2 (unauthorized access to shares, information disclosure, potential pivoting)
- Risk Score: 4 — Severity: Medium

Recommendation:
- Disable NetBIOS over TCP/IP if not required.
- Harden share permissions and require authentication.
- Use smb signing and restrict SMB to trusted hosts.

Port 445 — SMB (Direct-over-TCP)
---------------------------------
Description:
- Port 445 runs SMB directly over TCP (modern Windows file sharing). It is a frequent target for remote code execution and wormable CVEs.
- Misconfigurations, weak credentials, or unpatched SMB implementations can allow RCE and lateral movement.

Risk Assessment
- Likelihood: 3 (many public exploits/PoCs for unpatched SMB)
- Impact: 3 (remote code execution, data access, domain compromise in worst case)
- Risk Score: 9 — Severity: High

Recommendation:
- Patch SMB implementations promptly (apply vendor security updates).
- Restrict SMB exposure to internal networks; block from Internet.
- Enforce strong authentication, restricted share ACLs, and monitoring
