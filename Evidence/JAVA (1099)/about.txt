Port 1099 is the default port used by the Java RMI Registry (Remote Method Invocation) service.
Java RMI allows a Java application running on one machine to invoke methods on an object located on another machine, as if it were local. This makes it useful for distributed systems, remote administration, and client-server applications.

Key Points

Service: Java RMI Registry

Default Port: 1099 (TCP)

Purpose: Stores and manages remote object references so clients can locate and communicate with them.

Common Use: Remote Java applications, middleware, and enterprise solutions.

Security Risks

Port 1099 can be high-risk if left exposed:

Remote code execution vulnerabilities (e.g., unsafe deserialization)

Unauthorized access to RMI objects

Attackers can register malicious objects

Often targeted during penetration tests (e.g., exploits in Metasploit)

How to Protect It

Restrict access using firewall rules

Enable RMI security policies

Use SSL/TLS for encrypted communication

Disable the registry if not needed

Avoid exposing it to the internet
