Port 1524 — ingreslock / legacy service / lab backdoor
-------------------------------------------------------
Description:
- IANA assignment: ingreslock (historical). In many test labs (e.g., Metasploitable) port 1524 is used to host intentionally vulnerable/backdoor services.
- Actual risk depends entirely on the service/version running on this port. In real environments it may be unused or service-specific.

Risk Assessment
- Likelihood: 2–3 (2 if unknown/rare service; 3 if a known backdoor or PoC exists)
- Impact: 2–3 (could range from info disclosure to remote shell/root on vulnerable implementations)
- Risk Score: 4–9 — Severity: Medium to High (evaluate case-by-case)

Recommendation:
- Identify the exact service and version (nmap -sV -p1524) before assessment.
- If service is unnecessary, close the port; otherwise patch/replace the service.
- On lab targets: document PoC carefully and revert to snapshot after testing.

General notes for documentation:
- For each port include: nmap output file, any vuln scan/nessus output, exploit reference (searchsploit / Metasploit module), and a screenshot (proof).  
- Use the Likelihood × Impact method to fill the Findings table in the report.  
- Never publish sensitive data (password hashes, full /etc/shadow) in a public repo — include only redacted evidence or private ZIP for the instructor.
