Port 6667 — IRC (Internet Relay Chat)
-------------------------------------

Description:
- Port 6667/tcp is commonly used for IRC (Internet Relay Chat) servers and clients.
- IRC is a text-based chat protocol; servers host channels and clients connect to channels for real-time messaging.
- Attackers sometimes use IRC servers or clients as C2 (command and control) channels for botnets, or exploit vulnerable IRC daemons.

Risk Assessment (Likelihood × Impact)
- Likelihood: 1–3
  - 3 = Publicly exposed IRC service known to be part of C2 or running a vulnerable daemon with public PoC.
  - 2 = IRC reachable internally or requires specific conditions; some risk of misuse or information disclosure.
  - 1 = IRC not exposed to untrusted networks or protected by strong controls.
- Impact: 2
  - IRC itself typically exposes text/metadata (nicknames, channels), but if used as C2 or combined with vulnerable services it can enable remote control or data exfiltration.
- Risk Score: 2–6 — Severity: critical  

Recommendation:
- Do not expose IRC servers to the Internet unless necessary. If required, restrict access by ACLs and VPN.
- Monitor outgoing and incoming connections to IRC ports for unusual activity.
- Patch and harden IRC daemons; disable unnecessary bots or services.
- Treat detection of IRC C2 traffic as a high-priority incident for investigation.
